;;
;; In this project you will design a simple one line text editor.  
;;
;; The screen looks like:
;; 
;;     abc|def
;;
;; where | is the cursor.
;;
;; Typing a character inserts that character before the cursor.
;; The backspace key deletes the character before the cursor.
;; The left and right arrow keys move the cursor left and right.

;; =================================================================================
;; Constants:

(define WIDTH  200)
(define HEIGHT  20)

(define TEXT-SIZE  18)
(define TEXT-COLOR "BLACK")

(define CURSOR (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red"))

(define MTS (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT))



;; =================================================================================
;; Data Definitions:

(define-struct editor (txt cp))
;; Editor is (make-editor String Natural)
;; interp. the current text (txt) and cursor position (cp) using a 0-based index

(define ED1 (make-editor ""       0)) ; empty
(define ED2 (make-editor "abcdef" 0)) ; cursor at beginning as in |abcdef
(define ED3 (make-editor "abcdef" 3)) ; cursor in middle of text as in abc|def
(define ED4 (make-editor "abcdef" 6)) ; cursor at end as in abcdef|
